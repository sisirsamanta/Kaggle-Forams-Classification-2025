# Kaggle-Forams-Classification-2025

Overview
Goal:
Welcome to the Forams Classification 2025 Challenge! Your task is to classify volumetric µCT images of foraminifera tests—the calcium carbonate shells of planktonic foraminifera. The goal is to develop an efficient method for species classification with minimal time spent on annotation. To support this, we have provided a dataset of 18,426 volumes, of which only 210 are labeled. This challenge can be addressed using a semi-supervised classification model.

Why does it matter?
Planktonic foraminifera (aka forams) are tiny organisms that inhabit the sea waters. Forams produce a unique calcium carbonate shell, called a test, which can consist of multiple chambers and exhibit elaborate structures. Foraminifera tests are preserved in sea sediments for millions of years. Since certain types of foraminifera only live in specific conditions, identifying the composition of the foraminifera sediments allows us to gain insights into past environmental conditions.

With µCT scanning, we can scan thousands of forams in a single scan. By determining the species composition, we can efficiently understand how the environment has evolved.
